    <h1>COMPARE AND CONTRAST THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LER, VAR & CONST</h1>
   <h2> Scope</h2>
    <p>
        var: Function scope, meaning it's accessible throughout the function it's declared in, including inner blocks.
        let and const: Block scope, meaning they're only accessible within the block (e.g., if statement, loop, or function) they're declared in.
    </p>
    <h2>Hoisting</h2>
    <p>
        var: Variables are "hoisted" to the top of their scope, regardless of where the actual declaration is made. This means you can use a var variable before it's declared.
         let and const: Also hoisted, but not initialized until they're declared. Trying to use them before declaration results in a ReferenceError.
    </p>
    <h2>Reassignment</h2>
    <p>
        var and let: Can be reassigned.
     const: Cannot be reassigned. However, if the value is an object or array, its properties or elements can still be modified.
    </p>
    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <p>
        - Use const for values that shouldn't change.
        - Use let for values that may change.
        - Avoid using var unless you need function scope.
